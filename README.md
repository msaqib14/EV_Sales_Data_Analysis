 #    Ev Sales Data Analysis 

 ### Overview

 Zoom Electric (ZE) is an electric vehicle venture owned by a renowned automotive manufacturer called ZOOM MOTORS India Private Limited.
 
Zoom Electric offers a range of automotive and scooter products, including FioNex, Sprint, and Parker, along with some exclusive limited-edition variants.

Recently, ZE introduced a new scooter model called Sprint in the electric two-wheeler segment. Initially, the sales numbers for Sprint Scooters were quite impressive during the first two weeks of its launch. However, unexpectedly, there was a sudden decline in sales thereafter.

## Problem 
As a data analyst, you have been assigned to validate the sales drop for Sprint scooters and figure out the reasons for this decline.

Step 1 : Quantifying the sales drop from the spring scooter, since its launch. Use only the month in which it was launched. I.e if it was launched in October 2016, the we will only consider the October 2016 month.

Step 2 : Finding the reason for the decline : 
Here we will take two assumptions.
H1: One is to check of the launch date of this scooter has any impact on the sales. 
H2: is to check if the marketing campaign was effective or not.

------------------------------

Here my analysis involved two key steps:


Step 1: Quantifying the Sales Drop
I successfully quantified the decline in Sprint scooter sales volume, focusing exclusively on the month of October 2016.

By examining cumulative sales volume over a rolling 7-day period and using a formula to calculate the change in sales volume, I confirmed a significant decrease in sales, validating a 20% drop.

Step 2: Finding the Reasons for the Sales Decline
H1 - Launch Date Impact:

I compared the growth rate of Sprint scooters launched in the second half of the year with other products launched in the first half.

Analyzing the sales growth in the first three weeks after the Sprint scooter's launch, I demonstrated that launch date had not impact on sales, providing valuable insights into this aspect.
H2- Email Campaign Effectiveness:

I collected and analyzed data related to the email campaign for Sprint scooters, including data from two months before the product launch.

Calculating Email Opening Rate and Click Rate, 
I compared these metrics to industry benchmarks (18% Email Opening Rate and 8% Click Rate).
